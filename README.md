# Go Microservices Project

This is a Go microservices project that showcases the development of a microservices-based application using the Go programming language. Microservices architecture is a design approach where an application is composed of small, loosely coupled services that work together to provide the complete functionality of the application.

> In development

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/): The Go programming language (version X.X.X).
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): For containerization (optional).
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/): For managing multi-container Docker applications (optional).
- [Protobuf Compiler](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/downloads): If you're using gRPC and protocol buffers.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bl1nkker/go-microservices.git
   cd go-microservices
   ```

2. Build and run the microservices:

   ```bash
   # Example for running a microservice
   cd cmd/microservice-name
   go build
   ./microservice-name
   ```

3. You can also use Docker Compose for managing the services in containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Services
